# Updates for Meteor's Underscore

Meteor (1.2.0.2) uses a version of Underscore forked from 1.5.2. There's been a
lot of good stuff added to Underscore since then! This package extends the `_` variable with selected
functions from the latest version of Underscore, copied from its source.

## Adding

Add this to your app with:

```
meteor add mixmax:underscore-updates
```

## Functions Added

* [mapObject](http://underscorejs.org/#mapObject)
* [findIndex](http://underscorejs.org/#findIndex)
* [findLastIndex](http://underscorejs.org/#findLastIndex)

## Contributing

We welcome all contributions! This package only contains the functions needed by Mixmax at present,
but additions are welcome.
